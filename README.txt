Fix v9 â€” Rectangular Menus

What this does:
- Turns home game buttons (.game-btn) into rectangles
- Turns in-game section cards (.section-card) into rectangles
- Adds a subtle hover elevation

How to install:
1) Replace your CSS with ONE of these (choose the path your pages actually load):
   - /style.css  (root)
   - /assets/style.css  (if your HTML links assets/style.css)
2) No HTML changes required.
3) Hard refresh the site (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R).

If you also want CHARACTER cards rectangular,
the rule at the bottom sets .card to squared corners.
