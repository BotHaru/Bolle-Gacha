   - /style.css   (if your <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">)
   - /assets/style.css  (if your <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/style.css">)
2) Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R).

This CSS includes:
- Base dark theme (body, header, footer, container)
- Rectangular game buttons (.game-btn) and section cards (.section-card)
- Character list flex layout (.cards, .card) with small thumbnails
